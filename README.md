# a-fetch
Simple af fetcher tool for a large portion of Linux distros (planned support for Void and more soon)

Its just a fun little project I'm working on. 

# Requirements

Git, Bash (or bash based shell). 

# How to use

`git clone https://www.github.com/aaron-dev-git/a-fetch`

`cd a-fetch`

`bash a-fetch.sh`

 arch users may need to install `xorg-xdpyinfo` via pacman for resolution to work
