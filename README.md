# a-fetch
Simple af fetcher tool for a large portion of Linux distros (planned support for Void and more soon)

Its just a fun little project I'm working on. 


# How to use (not installable yet)

`git clone https://www.github.com/anime-is-real/a-fetch`

 arch users may need to install `xorg-xdpyinfo` via pacman for resolution to work
